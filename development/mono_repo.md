In a monorepo structure, the root folder typically contains dependencies that are shared or used globally across different parts of the project. These could include development tools, build tools, and other utilities that are not specific to either the frontend or backend.

Here are some examples of packages that you might consider installing in the root folder of a monorepo:

1. **Development Tools:**
   - `eslint`: A linting tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
   - `prettier`: A code formatter for maintaining consistent code style.
   - `husky`: A tool for managing Git hooks.
   - `lint-staged`: A tool for running scripts on pre-committed files.

2. **Build Tools:**
   - `cross-env`: A package for setting environment variables across different platforms.
   - `concurrently`: A tool for running multiple npm scripts concurrently.

3. **Utilities:**
   - `rimraf`: A cross-platform utility for removing files and directories.

4. **Monorepo Management:**
   - `lerna`: A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.

Here's an example of how you might install these packages in the root folder:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint prettier husky lint-staged cross-env concurrently rimraf lerna
```

Remember that the specific packages you need may vary depending on the requirements and structure of your monorepo. Always refer to the documentation of each package to understand its purpose and how it fits into your project.

Additionally, if you're using a specific monorepo management tool (like Lerna), you might need to install it in the root folder to facilitate managing multiple packages within your monorepo.
