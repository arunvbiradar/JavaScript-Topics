1. **Definition:**
   - A higher-order function in JavaScript is a function that can take another function as an argument or can return a function as a result.

2. **Why the topic came into picture/Brief history:**
   - Higher-order functions became prominent with the advent of functional programming concepts in JavaScript. Functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` were introduced to provide a more expressive and concise way to work with collections of data.

3. **Advantages:**
   - **Abstraction:** Higher-order functions allow you to abstract over actions, promoting code reuse and modularity.
   - **Flexibility:** They make code more flexible and adaptable, enabling developers to write more generic and reusable code.
   - **Readability:** Using higher-order functions often results in more readable and concise code.

4. **Disadvantages:**
   - **Learning Curve:** For those new to functional programming concepts, understanding and using higher-order functions might have a learning curve.
   - **Performance Concerns:** In some cases, using higher-order functions might introduce a slight overhead compared to imperative counterparts.

5. **3 to 4 Examples:**
   - Example 1: Using `map` to transform an array.
     ```javascript
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
     const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
     ```

   - Example 2: Utilizing `filter` to extract specific elements from an array.
     ```javascript
     const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
     ```

   - Example 3: Applying `reduce` to accumulate values in an array.
     ```javascript
     const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
     ```

   - Example 4: Passing a function as an argument.
     ```javascript
     function executeOperation(operation, a, b) {
       return operation(a, b);
     }
     ```

6. **Real World Examples:**
   - Libraries like lodash extensively use higher-order functions for operations on arrays and objects.
   - Event handling in JavaScript often involves passing functions as callbacks, a form of higher-order function usage.

7. **Production Grade Examples:**
   - In a real-world application, you might use higher-order functions to handle asynchronous operations using functions like `Promise.then` or `async/await`.
   - Middleware in frameworks like Express.js for handling HTTP requests is implemented using higher-order functions.
